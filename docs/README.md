# orthodox-calendar Docs

This folder aggregates technical documentation for the monorepo (backend + frontend), including architecture, API definitions, build/run/test flows, and deployment notes.

- `architecture.md` — overview diagrams and component responsibilities.
- `backend.md` — API endpoints, payloads, data model, calendar handling, connectors, and testing.
- `frontend.md` — UI flows, environment config, build/run instructions, and integration with the backend.
- `dev-workflows.md` — common commands for local dev, Docker usage, scripts (`./build`, `./run`, `./start`, `./stop`), and submodule setup.
